**Short summary:** COVID-19 can result in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has widespread effects on the body. Governments around the world have imposed strict restrictions in order to reduce the spread of the disease and flatten the curve to avoid overwhelming healthcare services. These restrictions include isolation and the practice of social distancing, which could unintentionally impact our exercise behaviours. Thus, the purpose of this study is to understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity levels and health-related quality of life in adults with a neurologically-related mobility disability. We plan to capture changes over time as the UK Government alters their procedures to manage this pandemic. Information gathered will help us to better support individuals with physical disabilities, not only during future pandemics or serious global events, but during their everyday lives to engage in health promoting behaviours.
